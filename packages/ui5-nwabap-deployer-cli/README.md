# ui5-nwabap-deployer-cli

`ui5-nwabap-deployer-cli` is a CLI tooling which allows to deploy UI5 sources to a SAP NetWeaver ABAP application server.

Starting from version 2.0.0 this deployer uses the OData Service [/UI5/ABAP_RESPOSITORY_SRV](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/a883327a82ef4cc792f3c1e7b7a48de8) for deploying UI5 sources. Please make sure that the service is activated on your system (for details you can check SAP note [2999557](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2999557)). The new service does some sanity checks like e.g. virus scans. If you have not configured virus scan profiles or want to disable virus scanning please have a look to SAP note [2437892](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2437892).
</br>Current deployer versions starting from version 2.0.0 can be used with SAP systems on which component SAP_UI 753 is installed. On systems with a lower version of component SAP_UI, you have to use version 1.x.x of this deployer.

## CLI Commands for `ui5-deployer`

### deploy

The `deploy` command deploys UI5 sources to an ABAP system. It provides following arguments.

|Option|Description|Mandatory|Default Value|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|config |Configuration file containing options for. By default for a file './.ui5deployrc' is searched. If no file is found, it is ignored. Options defined in the configuration file are always overwritten in case they are applied on the command line. Consider to never store the user and password in the config file if the file is shared, provide them as command line arguments.|-|-|
|cwd |Directory in which files for deployment are available.|X|./dist|
|files |Glob pattern to match files for deployment.|X|**/\*.\*|
|server |SAP NetWeaver ABAP application server information in form protocol://host:port|X|-|
|client |Client of SAP NetWeaver ABAP application server; if not set default client of server is used.|-|-|
|user |User used for logon to SAP NetWeaver ABAP application server.|X (in case no bearer token is used)|-|
|pwd |Password used for logon to SAP NetWeaver ABAP application server.|X (in case no bearer token is used)|-|
|bearerToken |Bearer token used for authorization.|X (in user/pwd is not used)|-|
|useStrictSSL |SSL mode handling. In case of self signed certificates the useStrictSSL mode option can be set to false to allow a deployment of files.|-|true|
|proxy |Proxy to be used for communication to SAP NetWeaver ABAP application server, form protocol://host:port|-|-|
|customQueryParams |Additional query parameters to be appended to the server calls. To be provided in form `parameterName=parameterValue`|-|-|
|language |Language for deployment.|-|EN|
|package |Defines the development package in which the BSP container for the UI5 sources is available or should be created.|X|-|
|bspContainer |Defines the name of the BSP container used for the storage of the UI5 sources. Length is restricted to 15 characters (exclusive customer specific namespaces, e.g. /YYY/).|X|-|
|bspContainerText |Defines the description of the BSP container.|X|-|
|transportNo |Defines the transport number which logs the changes|X (in case sources are not deployed as local objects)|-|
|createTransport |Set this option to true in case a new transport should be created each time the application is deployed.|-|false|
|transportText |Text for transport to be created.|X (in case a transport has to be created)|-|
|transportUseLocked |If a deployment failed due to the BSP application is locked in another transport, the old (original one) transport will be used to deploy the files.|-|false|
|transportUseUserMatch |It will be tried to find a transport request of the given user. If no transport is found and createTransport is enabled a new one will be created and used for further file deployments.|-|false|

Providing the options for the `deploy` command can be done by a configuration file. By default the command searches for a file `./ui5deployrc`. Using the option `--config` an alternative file name can be provided. In the configuration file all options can be provided which are available as command line arguments. The configuration must be provided as JSON object.

Configuration file example with dummy data. Consider: Do not configure the user/password and bearer token in the file if shared; provide them as command line arguments.
```json
{
    "cwd": "./dist",
    "files": "**/*.*",
    "server": "http://localhost:8000",
    "client": "100",
    "user": "testuser",
    "pwd": "abcd1234",   
    "bearerToken": "eadfadfdsf...", 
	"useStrictSSL": false,
    "proxy": "http://proxy:3000",
    "customQueryParams": {
        "parameter1": "Test",
        "parameter2": 1234
    },
    "language": "EN",
    "package": "ZZ_UI5_REPOSITORY",
    "bspContainer": "ZZ_UI5_TEST",
    "bspContainerText": "Test UI5 Upload",
    "transportNo": "A4HK900000",
    "createTransport": false,
    "transportText": "Test Transport",
    "transportUseLocked": false,
    "transportUseUserMatch": false
}
```
In a configuration file not all options must be maintained. It is possible to maintain standard options in the configuration file and provide other ones as command line arguments (like the user and password or the transport number). If an option is defined in the configuration file and provided as command line argument, always the value from the command line argument is taken.

### undeploy

The `undeploy` command undeploys UI5 sources from an ABAP system. It provides following arguments.

|Option|Description|Mandatory|Default Value|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|config |Configuration file containing options for. By default for a file './.ui5deployrc' is searched. If no file is found, it is ignored. Options defined in the configuration file are always overwritten in case they are applied on the command line. Consider to never store the user and password in the config file if the file is shared, provide them as command line arguments.|-|-|

|transportText |Text for transport to be created.|X (in case a transport has to be created)|-|
|transportUseLocked |If an undeployment failed due to the BSP application is locked in another transport, the old (original one) transport will be used to undeploy the files.|-|false|

Providing the options for the `undeploy` command can be done by a configuration file. By default the command searches for a file `./ui5deployrc`. Using the option `--config` an alternative file name can be provided. In the configuration file all options can be provided which are available as command line arguments. The configuration must be provided as JSON object. The same configuration file as for the `deploy` command can be used. Not relevant settings are ignored.

## Examples for `deploy` command

ui5-deployer deploy --server http://localhost:8000 --client "001" --user DEVELOPER --pwd myDeveloperPwd --package ZZ_UI5_REPOSITORY --bspContainer ZZ_UI5_TEST --bspContainerText "Crazy UI5 App" --createTransport true --transportText "UI5 App Development" --transportUseLocked true
```

### Deploy an UI5 app - specific configuration file + user/password as command line arguments
