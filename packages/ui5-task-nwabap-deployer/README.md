# ui5-task-nwabap-deployer

`ui5-task-nwabap-deployer` is a custom UI5 Tooling task which allows to directly deploy the builded sources to a SAP NetWeaver ABAP application server. 

## Install
```bash
npm install ui5-task-nwabap-deployer --save-dev
```

## Configuration Options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)

- resources
    - pattern: optional `string` | `array` glob pattern to match files for deployment (e.g. `**/*.*` to match all files); if not set `**/*.*` is used
- connection
    - server: `string` SAP NetWeaver ABAP application server information in form `protocol://host:port` (alternative: set environment variable `UI5_TASK_NWABAP_DEPLOYER__SERVER`)
    - client: optional `string` Client of SAP NetWeaver ABAP application server; if not set default client of server is used (alternative: set environment variable `UI5_TASK_NWABAP_DEPLOYER__CLIENT`)
    - useStrictSSL: optional `true|false` SSL mode handling. In case of self signed certificates the useStrictSSL mode option can be set to false to allow a deployment of files; default value: `true`
    - proxy: optional `string` Proxy to be used for communication to SAP NetWeaver ABAP application server (e.g. `http://myproxyhost:3128`).
- authentication
    - user: `string`User used for logon to SAP NetWeaver ABAP application server (alternative: set environment variable `UI5_TASK_NWABAP_DEPLOYER__USER`)
    - password: `string` Password used for logon to SAP NetWeaver ABAP application server (alternative: set environment variable `UI5_TASK_NWABAP_DEPLOYER__PASSWORD`)
- ui5
    - language: optional `string` Language for deployment (e.g. EN); default value `EN`
    - package: `string` Defines the development package in which the BSP container for the UI5 sources is available or should be created.
    - bspContainer: `string` Defines the name of the BSP container used for the storage of the UI5 sources. Length is restricted to 15 characters (exclusive customer specific namespaces, e.g. /YYY/).
    - bspContainerText: `string` Defines the description of the BSP container.
    - transportNo: optional (in case package is set to `$TMP`) `string` Defines the transport number which logs the changes (alternative: set environment variable `UI5_TASK_NWABAP_DEPLOYER__TRANSPORTNO`).
    - createTransport: optional `true|false` Set this option to true in case a new transport should be created each time the application is deployed.
    - transportText: optional `string` Text for transport to be created.
    - transportUseUserMatch: optional `true|false` It will be tried to find a transport request of the given user. If no transport is found and createTransport is enabled a new one will be created and used for further file deployments.
    - transportUseLocked: optional `true|false` If a deplyoment failed due to the BSP application is locked in another transport, the old (original one) transport will be used to deploy the files.
    - calculateApplicationIndex: optional `true|false` Specify if you require the application index (program /UI5/APP_INDEX_CALCULATE) for the application to be recalculated after the BSP application is deployed. Note: This only works with team repository provider version 1.30.x or higher and User Interface Add-On 2.0 for SAP NetWeaver.
