## 2.0.0 (2021-06-18)

### Features
- Usage of /UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV service for deployment instead of Team Provider API. 
  </br>Team Provider API was set to deprecated. As a consequence starting from version 2.0.0 this deployer supports only systems with at least SAP_UI 753 component installed.
  </br>For all previous versions, version 1.x.x of this deployer needs to be used.
